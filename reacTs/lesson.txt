Using TS with React and Redux.
-> Pros: 1. Far easier to avoid extremely common typos, like incorrect action types.
         2. Gives devs a far better understanding of the type of data flowing around.
         3. Much easier to refactor just about anything.

It's great to use it, but be aware of:
-> Cons: 1. Not the best type definition files (especially around Redux).
         2. Tons of generics flying around.
         3. Many imports, as just about everything (action creator, action, reducer, store, component) need to be aware of diff types.
         4. Redux inherently functional in nature, tough integration with TS classes.

Let's create UserEdit with UserShow and UserForm

-> Each view *must* produce HTML.
-> We should be able to nest one view's HTML in another.
-> We need to have a good way to handle user events (clicking, typing, etc).
-> There will probably be a tight coupling between a view and a model.
-> We need to be able to reach into the HTML produced by a view and get a specific element.

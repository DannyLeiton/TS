This is a series of examples of the usage of TypeScript in order to take
advantage of all of its features by making some example projects.
We have 9 different projects:
-> features: is a folder with TS use cases.
-> fetchjson: simple axios todo items.
-> maps: app that shows user and company using the "mappable" interface.
-> sort: simple bubblesort using interfaces.
-> sortRefactored: simple bubblesort using abstract classes.
-> stats: uses an approach with inheritance and other with class composition.
-> typpie: web framework using TS, something like backbone + handlebars.
-> typoo: express + TS.
-> reacTS: React + Redux + TS.
